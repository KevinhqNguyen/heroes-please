# The Pitiful Human Lizard
This Toronto based super hero is anything but exciting. Where most Super Heroes are often described as"The Amazing" Spiderman or "The Fantastic" Four this hero is known as "The Pitiful". This comic book series written and drawn by Toronto based cartoonist Jason Loo follows the life of coroporate lacky Lucas Barret who finds excitement outside his 9-5 job as a struggling superhero. Jason Loo's characters live and breath in the setting that is Toronto with inconic Toronto landmarks sprinked through every issue. AS it has been critically described. 

"The Pitiful Human Lizard is a fun, sincere read that pays strong homage to its superhero comic roots while making conscious effort to pave its own way. It has a strong future as a series, and of developing its own sets of gripping lore and canon, while remaining a distinctly (and delightfully) Canadian piece of art." (Paper Droid)
